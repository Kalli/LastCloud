# Lastcloud #


## About ##
Lastcloud is an api mashup/hack that finds cloudcasts (mixes, radioshows, podcasts etc) on [Mixcloud.com](http://www.mixcloud.com) that feature music from your favorite artists on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm). Lastcloud is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app, written in [Python](http://www.python.org/). The frontend uses [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) and [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/).  

## Installation / Use ##
I've not yet made a packaged version of this app. But you can download the source from Github and try it out. There are no requirements beyond the Python Standard Library, but you'll need an [api key from Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/api/account) which you should paste in your settings.py or similar. 

## Demo / Example ##
A working demo of Lastcloud can be found at [http://apps.karltryggvason.com/lastcloud](http://apps.karltryggvason.com/lastcloud)

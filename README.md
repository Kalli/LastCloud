# Lastcloud #


## About ##
Lastcloud was an api mashup/hack that finds cloudcasts (mixes, radioshows, podcasts etc) on [Mixcloud.com](http://www.mixcloud.com) that feature music from your favorite artists on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm). Lastcloud is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app, written in [Python](http://www.python.org/). The frontend uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/). Unfortunately the Mixcloud api has since changed and it is no longer possible to search for mixes by artist!
